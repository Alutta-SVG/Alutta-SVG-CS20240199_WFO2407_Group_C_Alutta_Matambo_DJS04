This provided code defines a custom HTML element called book preview using the Web Components API. This element displays a preview of a book, including its image, title, and author. Here's a breakdown of the key components of the code:

Constructor: The constructor method initializes the custom element and attaches a shadow DOM to it for encapsulation. The render method is called to set up the initial display of the element.

Observed Attributes: The observedAttributes static getter specifies which attributes the element will respond to when they change. In this case, it observes data-image, data-title, data-author, and data-preview.

Attribute Change Handling: The attributeChangedCallback method is invoked whenever one of the observed attributes changes. This method calls render to update the display with the new attribute values.

Render Method: The render method constructs the inner HTML of the shadow DOM. It retrieves the values of the observed attributes and provides default values if they are not set. It also sets up an event listener on the book preview div to dispatch a custom event (book-select) when the element is clicked, passing the book's ID as the event detail.

Styling: The styles defined within the style tag in the render method apply to the book preview, including borders, padding, margins, and image size.

Custom Element Definition: Finally, the custom element is defined using customElements.define, adding the tag name book-preview with the BookPreview class.

The main issues that i had was with adding the  event listener to the book preview div and getting the book id from the data-book-id attribute. I also them had a 404  error when trying to load the image. I fixed the 404 error by changing the image path to  a relative path. I also fixed the event listener issue by changing the event listener to listen to the click event on the book preview div.
